This app allows you to enter in a NYC neighborhood, and recieve a list of all the restaurants in that neighborhood that have outdoor seating.

This app works with the Foursquare API, and makes requests to the `/explore` route. 

`New York, NY` is hardcoded into the route, so it will not work for any other city. `Outdoor Seating` is also hard-coded, so any other venue attributes will not work.
